# Progress: Voice Yann

## What Works
- ✅ Basic project structure with Next.js
- ✅ Frontend UI with recording controls
- ✅ Audio capture using MediaRecorder API
- ✅ Integration with Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API
- ✅ Basic transcription display
- ✅ Error handling for missing audio
- ✅ Clear transcription functionality
- ✅ Loading states during processing

## What's Left to Build
- ⏳ Streaming transcription for real-time results
- ⏳ Audio level visualization during recording
- ⏳ Multiple language support
- ⏳ Export functionality for transcriptions
- ⏳ User accounts and saved transcriptions
- ⏳ Mobile-optimized experience
- ⏳ Accessibility improvements
- ⏳ Advanced audio processing options

## Current Status
The application currently provides a functional demonstration of speech-to-text capabilities using Google Cloud's API. The core recording and transcription features are working, but they require proper Google Cloud credentials to function. The UI is clean and minimal, focusing on the core functionality.

## Known Issues
1. **Authentication**: Requires proper setup of Google Cloud credentials
2. **Audio Format**: Limited to WAV format with specific encoding
3. **Transcription Delay**: There's a noticeable delay between speaking and seeing the transcription
4. **Browser Support**: Requires a modern browser with MediaRecorder API support
5. **Error Handling**: Basic error handling implemented, but needs improvement for specific error cases
6. **No Persistence**: Transcriptions are lost on page reload

## Next Development Priorities
1. Implement streaming transcription for more immediate feedback
2. Add proper authentication setup instructions and error handling
3. Improve UI feedback during recording (audio visualization)
4. Add export functionality for saving transcriptions
5. Enhance error states and user feedback

# Product Context: Voice Yann

## Problem Space
Traditional note-taking and documentation methods can be inefficient during meetings, lectures, or personal idea generation. Many people prefer speaking over typing, especially when they need to capture thoughts quickly or when their hands are occupied.

Speech-to-text technology enables users to convert their spoken words into written text, providing an efficient alternative to manual typing. Voice Yann aims to demonstrate this capability with a focus on simplicity and immediacy.

## User Needs
1. **Efficiency**: Users need a quick way to convert spoken words to text without complex setup
2. **Accuracy**: The transcription must be accurate enough to be useful
3. **Immediacy**: Real-time feedback is essential for users to confirm their speech is being captured correctly
4. **Simplicity**: The interface should be intuitive, requiring minimal learning curve

## Target Users
- Students taking notes during lectures
- Professionals in meetings who need to document discussions
- Writers capturing ideas on-the-go
- Anyone with accessibility needs who prefers voice input over typing
- Developers exploring speech recognition capabilities

## User Experience Goals
1. **Intuitive Controls**: Clear, easy-to-understand buttons for record, stop, and clear functions
2. **Visual Feedback**: Users should receive clear indication when recording is active
3. **Real-time Display**: Text should appear as it's transcribed, not just at the end of recording
4. **Error Tolerance**: The application should gracefully handle permission denials, transcription errors, or connectivity issues

## Product Value Proposition
Voice Yann provides a frictionless way to convert speech to text, giving users the ability to capture thoughts or information without the constraints of typing. It showcases the power of Google's Speech-to-Text API in a simple, focused interface that prioritizes immediacy and accuracy.

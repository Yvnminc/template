# Active Context: Voice Yann

## Current Work Focus
We've successfully implemented the core functionality of the Voice Yann application, including:

1. Frontend UI with record, stop, and clear controls
2. Audio capture using the MediaRecorder API
3. Basic integration with Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API
4. Transcription display

## Recent Changes
- Created the initial project structure based on Next.js template
- Implemented the basic UI with TailwindCSS for styling
- Set up Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API integration
- Added placeholder configuration for Google Cloud credentials
- Created memory bank documentation

## Next Steps
1. **Authentication Integration**:
   - Add proper Google Cloud authentication setup instructions
   - Improve error handling for authentication issues

2. **Streaming Transcription**:
   - Implement real-time streaming transcription for more immediate feedback
   - Enhance the PUT endpoint to support streaming recognition

3. **UI Enhancements**:
   - Add visual feedback during recording (e.g., audio level visualization)
   - Improve accessibility features
   - Add error state UI handling

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize audio processing for better results
   - Add support for different audio formats and quality settings

5. **Additional Features**:
   - Language selection
   - Export transcription results
   - Save recording history

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### API Design Decisions
- Chose to implement a RESTful API endpoint for simplicity
- Decided to process audio in chunks to handle longer recordings
- Selected LINEAR16 encoding for broad compatibility

### UI Design Decisions
- Minimalist interface to focus on core functionality
- Clear visual indicators for recording state
- Simple container for transcription output

### Technical Trade-offs
- Using browser's MediaRecorder API for simplicity, but with format limitations
- Prioritizing simplicity over advanced features for initial implementation
- Focusing on English language support initially for simplicity
